# Safety Tracker Django Back End -- OLDER VERSION

This api was initially created and worked on prior to us finishing our complete Django Backend Lecture with Tristan Hall. Once that lecture was completed, I realized that it was better Django Backend practices to create this api with setting up authentication first. Thus, I started creating my newer version of the app. It can be found at https://github.com/SylviaRemington/safety-tracker-django-back-end. <br> The newest version of safety-tracker-django-back-end is currently in progress.

**Ultimately, this beginning of an api was just practice before I created the real thing!**

**This version was only Part One Setup - from Tristan Hall's initial lesson from django-books-api.**
